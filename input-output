### This example is taken from Miller and Blair (1985)

### Example 1

### Suppose a simple economy has two sectors, agriculture and manufacturing

### Agriculture produces $150 value to satisfy its own need, and $500 
### to satisfy manufacturing

### Manufacturing produces $100 value for its own need, and $200 for
### Agriculture.

### Placing this into a sector flow 

### Intermediate flow matrix.

flowtable <- rbind( c( 150 , 500 ), c( 200 , 100 ) )

flowtable
#     [,1] [,2]
#[1,]  150  500
#[2,]  200  100

### row 1 represents the output from Agriculture, which contributes as an
### input to column 1 (Agriculture) and column 2 (Manufacturing).

### In addition to meeting the needs of other areas of the economy
### sectors must also satisfy a consumption demand. Which for each
### sector is the following;

D <- rbind (350,1700)
D
#     [,1]
#[1,]  350
#[2,] 1700

### That is $350 of Agriculture product and $1700 of Manufacturing

inputoutputtable <- cbind(flowtable, D)
inputoutputtable <- as.data.frame(inputoutputtable)
names( inputoutputtable ) <- c("x1" , "x2" , "finaldemand")

### This means that both sectors must meet a total output which is the sum
### of each of these.

inputoutputtable$totaloutput <- inputoutputtable$x1 +
                                inputoutputtable$x2 +
                                inputoutputtable$finaldemand

inputoutputtable
#   x1  x2 finaldemand totaloutput
#1 150 500         350        1000
#2 200 100        1700        2000


totaloutput <- inputoutputtable$totaloutput

### Now we derive the technical coefficient matrix. A column of this matrix 
### represents an industrial recipe used to produce a single industry good.

### We calculate this matrix by dividing intersectoral flows by the total output 
### of each columns sector. 

### For instance, Agriculture ships $500 worth of goods to Manufacturing. 
### Manufacturing produces $2000 of total output. Therefore, one dollar of 
### Agricultural product is absorbed to produce 25 cents of Manufacturing
### product.

### Agriculture ships $500 to Manufacturing, Manufacturing produces $2000 
### overall. Thefore, $500/$2000 = $0.25

### We cant divide matrices in the way we do in usual arithmetic. So we must
### solve the matrix first (find its inverse) and then multiply to obtain the
### comparable result. 

## Calcate coefficient matrix:
z <- ( totaloutput )^-1 * diag( 2 )
A <- flowtable %*% z

# Show A
A
#     [,1] [,2]
#[1,] 0.15 0.25
#[2,] 0.20 0.05

### A shows that to produce the total output of Manufacturing (column 2), 
### it requires 25% of Agricultures total output and 5% of Manufacturing 
### total output.

### Equally, 15% of Agricultures output goes back into Agriculture as an input
### and 20% of Manufacturings output is required back in Agriculture.

### The next step in understanding the network effect and interdependency of
### industries is to calculate the Leontief matrix. 

### First we substract the technical coefficient matrix from the identity matrix.

IminusA <- diag(2) - A

### Calculate the inverse

L <- solve(IminusA)

L
#          [,1]     [,2]
#[1,] 1.2541254 0.330033
#[2,] 0.2640264 1.122112

### This new matrix presents a multiplyer of the relationships between the sectors
### because of the total demand from both. 

### We can now answer the question, how much does each sector need to produce
### if there is a demand shock. 

### Current total demand for both sectors is given by the following vector,

inputoutputtable$finaldemand
#[1]  350 1700

### That is, a demand of 350 from Agriculture and 1700 from manufacturing. 

### If the demand from manufacturing drops to 1000. How much total output from 
### the two sectors is necessary to meet this demand. 

newdemand <- c(350,1000)

newoutput <- round(L %*% newdemand)

newoutput
#    [,1]
#[1,]  769
#[2,] 1215

### That is that output for agriculture drops by 23.1% and manufacturing output
### falls by 39.3%.
